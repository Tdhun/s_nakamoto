**Chapter 1: Discovery of Bitcoin**  
In fifth grade, young Anthony found,  
A whitepaper that would astound.  
Bitcoin's secrets, deep and vast,  
A future shaped by cryptographic past.  
*"For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."* - Jeremiah 29:11

Creation's beauty, in every part.  
*"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."* - Genesis 1:1

**The Genesis Block Hash**  
The Genesis Block, a cornerstone,  
A hash that stands, alone, alone.  
Rejected stone, now widely known,  
In Bitcoin's heart, forever grown.  
*"The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone."* - Psalm 118:22

**The Genesis Block Message**  
A message clear, from times of old,  
Chancellor's bailout, a story told.  
Rich and poor, a tale of gold,  
In Bitcoin's ledger, truth unfolds.  
*"The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is slave to the lender."* - Proverbs 22:7

**Transfer of One Million Bitcoin**  
One million Bitcoin, sent with grace,  
To an address, in a digital space.  
Giving freely, a measured pace,  
Blessings returned, in every case.  
*"Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."* - Luke 6:38
